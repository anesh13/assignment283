### CMPE 283
#### Assignment 1

**Steps I used to complete the assignment :**   
1. Downloaded and installed VMware Fusion for Mac OS.
2. Downloaded Ubuntu disk image from the internet.
3. From the VMware dashboard, created a VM.
4. Enabled VT-X/EPT in the VM settings.
5. Forked the https://github.com/torvalds/linux repository to my Github account (https://github.com/anesh13/linux).
6. On the VM's SSH shell, ran the *uname -r* command to check the OS version.
7. Ran the *sudo apt install make* and *sudo apt install gcc* commands.
8. Checked if gcc and make were properly installed by running *gcc -v* and *make -v* commands.
9. Ran the *sudo apt install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-bin  bridge-utils  virt-manager* command to install packages needed to build a kernel.
10. Created two directories by running the *mkdir linuxrepo* command and the *mkdir cmpe283* command.
10. Inside the *linuxrepo* directory, initialized git using *git init*.
11. Cloned the forked linux repository. This took a long time to fetch and failed a few times before I could successfully pull the code.
12. Similarly, inside the *cmpe283* directory, cloned the assignment repository (https://github.com/anesh13/assignment283) with the Makefile and .c files from Canvas.
14. Update the .c file to include the other capabilities by referring to the SDM manual. The volume and sections have been mentioned in comments in the code.
15. Inside this directory, ran the *make* command.
16. Ran the *ls* command.
  - Makefile
  - README.nd
  - cmpe283-1.k0
  - cmpe283-1 .mod.c
  - Module.symvers
  - cmpe283-1.c
  - cmpe283-1.mod
  - cmpe283-1.mod.o
  - cmpe283-1.
  - modules.order
17. Ran *sudo insmod ./cmpe283-1.ko* command.
18. Once the module was inserted, ran the *sudo dmesg* to display driver messages.
19. These are the outputs that the code I added generated.
